My name is Michael Cardei and I am Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/), where I work under the supervision of [Professor Ferdinando Fioretto](https://nandofioretto.github.io/). As a member of the [RAISE lab](https://nandofioretto.github.io/group/), my research is centered on Responsible Generative AI.

I completed my BS in Computer Science at the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/), where I performed research under the guidance of [Dr. My Thai](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~mythai/) in the areas of LLM's, Federated Learning, and XAI. I was part of the 2023 Robotics Institute Summer Scholars program [RISS](https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/) at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University where I worked on Computer Vision applications for Autonomous Vehicles under the guidance of [Dr. Srinivasa Narasimhan](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~srinivas/). In the summer of 2022, I was part of the Wake Forest University Center for Artificial Intelligence summer [REU](https://school.wakehealth.edu/departments/biomedical-engineering/center-for-injury-biomechanics/summer-research-opportunities) program under the guidance of [Dr. Umit Topaloglu](https://datascience.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/umit-topaloglu) researching ML privacy and bias.
