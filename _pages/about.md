My name is Michael Cardei and I am an incoming Computer Science student at the University of Virginia where I will be advised by [Professor Ferdinando Fioretto](https://nandofioretto.github.io/). As part of the [RAISE lab](https://nandofioretto.github.io/group/), my research will focus on Responsible Gen-AI.

Previously, I have completed my BS in Computer Science at the University of Florida. I have performed research at the University of Florida under the guidance of [Dr. My Thai](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~mythai/) in the areas of LLM's, Federated Learning, and XAI. I was part of the 2023 Robotics Institute Summer Scholars program [RISS](https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/) at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University where I worked on Computer Vision applications for Autonomous Vehicles under the guidance of [Dr. Srinivasa Narasimhan](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~srinivas/). In the summer of 2022 I particiapted in the Wake Forest University [REU](https://school.wakehealth.edu/departments/biomedical-engineering/center-for-injury-biomechanics/summer-research-opportunities) program under the guidance of [Dr. Umit Topaloglu](https://datascience.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/umit-topaloglu) researching ML privacy and bias.
